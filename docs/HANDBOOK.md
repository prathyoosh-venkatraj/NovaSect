## 0. The one idea behind NovaSect

NovaSect is a **free, static-hosted equity-research platform** made of three tools that share one
philosophy: **transparent, explainable models over live public data — no black boxes in the
browser.** Heavy compute runs client-side (so it's auditable) or in pre-generated reports; the
only thing hidden server-side is **API keys**, behind thin Vercel serverless proxies.

| | **Sentinel** | **Osiris** | **FinVault** |
|---|---|---|---|
| Question | What credit spread / default risk does this issuer carry *right now*? | What's the probability distribution of this stock's price over the next N days? | How financially healthy is this company, over 1 and 5 years? |
| Method | Synthetic credit-spread engine (macro + volatility + market legs) | Monte-Carlo stochastic simulation (OU / GBM-jump physics) | SEC-XBRL + 10-K analysis → pre-generated deep-dive report + live panels |
| Compute | Client-side, live, refreshes every ~5 s | Client-side, in a Web Worker, on demand | Offline pipeline (Claude-assisted) + live client panels |
| Freshness | FRED + Alpha Vantage via proxy | Yahoo + FRED via proxy | SEC EDGAR (pre-built) + Finnhub/Yahoo (live) |

**Shared infrastructure:** a Vercel static site + a handful of serverless API proxies that hide
keys and add edge caching, plus a GitHub-Actions layer for health checks and analytics.

committed and authoritative (Vercel runs a no-op build).

## 2. Sentinel — the credit-spread engine

**The mechanic:** for ~83 covered issuers (the `COMPANIES` array in `sentinel.v2.js`), Sentinel
computes a *synthetic credit spread* (in basis points over a sovereign rate) every ~5 s from live
macro data. It is not a market quote — it's a transparent model of what the spread *should* be,
which surfaces credit stress that equity prices alone don't show.

Each issuer carries hand-calibrated anchors: `baseSpread` (bps under neutral macro), `marketBeta`,
`sectorBeta`, `residual` (auto-calibrated), `rating` (IG/HY band), `country`, `base_rate_type`
(UST/BUND/GILT), `netLeverage`, `interestCoverage`, `lastVerified`.

**The spread is assembled from three legs**, scaled by a `sensitivity` factor (0.35 for IG, 1.0
for HY — HY reacts far more to volatility):

**Leg 1 — Macro anchor** (floors the spread at the rating cohort's market level):
```
macroAnchor = max(baseSpread, ratingIndexBps)        // ratingIndexBps = live ICE BofA OAS for the rating
```

**VIX beta-shift** (regime switch — when fear is high, idiosyncratic factors compress and
everything correlates toward the market):
```
cFactor             = min(0.8, max(0, (VIX − 25) / 25))
effectiveSectorBeta = (1 − cFactor)·sectorBeta + cFactor·1.0
effectiveMarketBeta = (1 − cFactor)·marketBeta + cFactor·1.0   // at VIX=50, all betas → 1.0
```

**Leg 2 — Volatility premium** (the convex core; a sigmoid captures credit risk accelerating as
volatility rises):
```
proxyVol      = sectorVol·effectiveSectorBeta + residual
mertonScalar  = 1.5 + 1.0 / (1 + exp(−0.4·(proxyVol − 35)))    // ranges 1.5 (low vol) → 2.5 (high vol)
volatilityPremium = proxyVol · mertonScalar · stressMultiplier · sensitivity
```

**Leg 3 — Market component** + **seniority/tenure** (instrument-specific):
```
marketComponent    = effectiveMarketBeta · 50 · stressMultiplier · sensitivity
seniorityMultiplier= Secured 0.85 | Unsecured 1.00 | Subordinated 1.5 + baseTotal/200
tenureMultiplier   = 1 + (selectedTenure − 10)·0.03
```

**Final assembly:**
```
liveSpread   = (macroAnchor + volatilityPremium + marketComponent) · seniorityMultiplier · tenureMultiplier
impliedYield = sovereignRate + liveSpread / 100        // sovereignRate = base rate + country premium
PoD          = 1 − exp(−spread/10000 · 10)             // 10-yr horizon, implicit LGD = 100%
```
*PoD caveat:* overstates default probability for IG names (LGD=100% is conservative) — it's a
**relative** signal, not an absolute valuation.

**Spread-driver decomposition** (`getSpreadDrivers`) splits the live spread into six labelled
components (Anchor, Market, Volatility-Pure, Residual, Seniority, Tenure) in bps and % of total —
so every number is attributable.

**Auto-calibration loop** (every ~2 h, 3 random issuers): fetch 30-day realized vol from Yahoo,
compare to the model's proxy vol, convert the error to bps (`volError% × 1.5 bps`), and nudge
`company.residual += volError`, lerped over ~5 s to avoid UI jumps. Sets a "Market Pulse" state
(STABLE / VOL SPIKE / CONVEX TRIGGER).

**Reference tables:** rating bands (AAA 30–150 … HY 200–700 bps), sovereign premiums (US/DE/UK 0,
IT 145, BR/IN 250 …), risk levels (NOMINAL <200, CAUTION 200–400, ELEVATED 400–800, CRITICAL
>800), verification age (Fresh <60d, Aging 60–90d, Stale >90d).

**History sparklines:** `api/sentinel-history.js` stores a 30-day spread snapshot per ticker in
Vercel KV (Upstash). **Writes are server-only** (require `SNAPSHOT_WRITE_SECRET`); the browser is
read-only.

---

## 3. Osiris — the Monte-Carlo simulation engine

**The mechanic:** for each covered ticker, Osiris runs thousands of stochastic price paths and
reports a **probability distribution** of outcomes (percentile bands + "probability of finishing
above today"), not a single point target. All simulation runs client-side in a Web Worker
(`stochasticWorker.min.js`).

**Physics by sector cohort** (`physics-config.json`, schema `v1.8-consumer-staples`):

| Cohort | Model | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Energy & Utilities | Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (mean-reverting) | commodity-cycle / regulated dynamics |
| Industrials & Defense | GBM + Jump Diffusion (Merton) | trend-following + discrete contract/shock events |

Per-ticker params (`reversionSpeedTheta`, `jumpFrequencyLambda`, `jumpMu`, `baselineVolatility`,
`creditRating`) are static; **beta, dividend yield, and the OU long-term mean are computed live**
at simulation time by `osirisIngestion.js`.

**Ingestion (`osirisIngestion.js`)** — cached in IndexedDB (24 h) + session memo:
```
β  = cov(stockLogReturns, SPYLogReturns) / var(SPYLogReturns)   // OLS vs SPY, ≥30 shared days
dividendYield      = Σ(TTM dividends) / currentPrice
longTermMeanPrice  = mean(adjClose over 1y)                      // OU reversion target
σ_annual           = stdDev(dailyLogReturns) · √252
drift              = US10Y(FRED) − dividendYield
```
For horizons ≤ 7 days it switches to **intraday realized vol** (5-min bars, per-day variance incl.
overnight gap: `RV = Σ(log(bar_t/bar_{t−1}))² + (log(open/prevClose))²`, annualised over the last
20 days). Earnings within the horizon (≤21 d) multiply that step's vol by 2.5×.

**Stochastic engines (`stochasticWorker.js`):**
```
Box-Muller:   Z = √(−2·ln(u))·cos(2π·v)
Antithetic:   path 2i+1 uses −Z of path 2i (variance reduction; jumps drawn independently)

OU (Energy/Utilities):
   S_{t+1} = S_t + θ(μ − S_t)·dt + σ·S_t·Z·√dt        // proportional σ·S keeps prices > 0

GBM + Jump (Industrials/Defense), Merton (1976), Itô-corrected + jump compensator:
   compensator = λ·(exp(jumpMu + 0.5·σ_J²) − 1)        // σ_J = 0.07 fixed (calibrated constant)
   logJump     = N(jumpMu, σ_J²)  if U(0,1) < λ·dt  else 0
   S_{t+1}     = S_t·exp((drift − compensator)·dt + σ·√dt·Z + logJump)
```
> Implementation note: the live worker layers a **GARCH(1,1)** time-varying-variance term on top
> of these forms (the formal docx shows the constant-σ teaching version). `jumpStd` is a fixed
> `0.07` constant (v1.7 calibration fix — an earlier `σ × 1.5` introduced a downward bias).

**Device path caps:** Mobile 10k · Desktop-Low 25k (HI-FI 50k) · Desktop-High 25k (HI-FI up to
250k) — chosen from pointer type, viewport, RAM and cores.

**Oracle (`osirisOracle.js`)** — turns the path cloud into a headline:
```
Primary:  winProbability = count(S_T > S_0) / totalPaths        // exact empirical
Fallback (Gaussian, Abramowitz-Stegun 7.1.26):
   impliedSigma = (p95 − p05) / (2 · 1.645)
   probability  = Φ((p50 − S_0) / impliedSigma)  clamped [1%, 99%]
```
Percentiles p05/p10/p25/p45–p55/p50/p75/p90/p95 + `pAboveSpot` are extracted from sorted terminal
values. **Rendering** (`osirisCloudCanvas.js`) is a DPI-scaled Canvas: heatmap bands (OU) or
green/red gain-loss zones with jump arrows (GBM-jump), temporal/spatial anchor lines, hover
scrubber.

## 4. FinVault — the equity-research layer

**The mechanic:** pre-generated deep-dive reports per company (10-K narrative + financial tables),
plus **live panels** in `report.html` (multiples, fundamentals, analyst estimates, 5-year trends).

**Offline report pipeline (`scripts/generate-report.mjs`, 8 steps):**
1. **CIK resolution** — map ticker → SEC Central Index Key via `company_tickers.json`.
2. **10-K retrieval** — latest annual filing from EDGAR submissions (10-K, or 20-F for foreign).
3. **Text extraction** — Item 1 (Business), 1A (Risk Factors), 7 (MD&A), capped 35k chars each.
4. **XBRL** (`fetchXBRL2` → SEC `companyfacts`) — ~20 GAAP concepts, each resolved against a
   fallback synonym chain (e.g. `Revenues → RevenueFromContractWithCustomer… → SalesRevenueNet`).
   Now keeps **5 fiscal years** per concept (was 2).
5. **Ratio computation** — see below.
6. **Markdown tables** — Income/Balance/Cash-Flow + Liquidity/Solvency/Profitability, **plus the
   Five-Year Financial Summary / Ratios / Growth-&-Trend block** (`scripts/lib/xbrl-history.mjs`).
7. **Claude API** — forensic-accounting system prompt + the tables + 10-K extracts → Markdown report.
8. **DOCX** — Markdown → `.docx`, stamped with company/ticker/date.

**Ratios (computed from XBRL, per year):**
```
EBITDA           = OperatingIncome + D&A
Net Debt         = (LongTermDebt + ShortTermDebt) − Cash
Current Ratio    = CurrentAssets / CurrentLiabilities
Quick Ratio      = (CurrentAssets − Inventory) / CurrentLiabilities
Debt/Equity      = TotalDebt / Equity
Net Leverage     = NetDebt / EBITDA
Interest Coverage= EBITDA / InterestExpense
Operating Margin = OperatingIncome / Revenue
Net Margin       = NetIncome / Revenue
ROA / ROE        = NetIncome / TotalAssets  ·  NetIncome / Equity
```

**Five-year horizontal analysis** (`xbrl-history.mjs`): `pickSeries()` merges synonym tags **by
fiscal year** (robust to tag drift) → 5 annual values per concept; `historyData()` derives the
ratio matrix + CAGRs (revenue / net income / EPS / FCF / dividend / book value) +
margin/leverage trend arrows. CAGR shows "n/m" on a sign change.

**Live in the browser (`report.html`):** TradingView chart; **Multiples** + **Fundamentals**
(Finnhub `stock/metric`); **Forward estimates** (Finnhub `recommendation` + `price-target`);
**Five-Year Trends** panel — Revenue/Net-Income bars + Margins/ROE lines + CAGR chips, fed by:
- `api/sec-proxy.js` for **US filers** — resolves ticker→CIK, fetches `companyfacts`, runs
  `_xbrl-history.js` server-side, returns a compact (~KB) `{years, summary, ratios, cagr}` payload.
- `api/yahoo-proxy.js?mode=financials` **fallback for non-US filers** — Yahoo annual
  income/balance/cash-flow statement history (~4 yrs) mapped into the same shape (operating margin
  often absent for foreign filers; revenue/net-margin/CAGRs populate).

**Static data layer (`data/universe.json`)** — one entry per covered company merging Sentinel +
Osiris + FinVault metadata (built offline by `build-universe.js`).

---

## 5. The serverless proxy layer (data flow)

All external calls route through Vercel functions to **hide API keys** and add **edge caching**.
No keys ever reach the browser; the proxies are same-origin so no CORS is needed.

| Proxy | Upstream | Used by | Cache TTL |
|---|---|---|---|
| `yahoo-proxy` | Yahoo (cookie+crumb auth) | Sentinel calibration, Osiris ingestion, FinVault | history 24 h, quote-summary 6 h, earnings 12 h, news 30 m, financials 24 h |
| `finnhub-proxy` | Finnhub (endpoint whitelist) | FinVault panels, news | 30 m – 24 h per endpoint |
| `fred-proxy` | FRED | rates (DGS10), VIX, OAS indices | 6–24 h |
| `alpha-proxy` | Alpha Vantage | Sentinel sector-ETF vol (XLE/XLU/XLI) | 12 h; **`degraded:true`** flag on fallback (never presents mock as live) |
| `sec-proxy` | SEC EDGAR | FinVault 5-yr (US) | 24 h |
| `sentinel-history` | Vercel KV / Upstash | Sentinel sparklines | read-only public; **writes require `SNAPSHOT_WRITE_SECRET`** |

**Shared `_ratelimit.js`:** distributed fixed-window limiter via Upstash Redis when configured,
in-memory fallback otherwise; client IP from the platform-set `x-forwarded-for`.

**GitHub Actions layer:**
- `health-checks.yml` (every ~2 h) → `scripts/health/run-all.mjs` → posts failures to Discord.
- `eod-report.yml` (daily ~22:00 Berlin) → `scripts/report/eod-umami.mjs` → pulls last-7-day Umami
  metrics (views, visitors, bounce, top pages/referrers, tracked click events) and posts a digest
  to Discord (`DISCORD_REPORT_WEBHOOK_URL` → falls back to `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL`).

---

## 6. Security & safety posture

- **Keys server-side only** (FRED/Finnhub/Alpha/Groq/Anthropic/Umami/`SNAPSHOT_WRITE_SECRET`/
  Upstash) — never in client or repo.
- **Headers** (`vercel.json`): HSTS-preload, `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN`, `nosniff`,
  Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy, and a **Content-Security-Policy (report-only)** allow-listing
  the exact CDNs (Tailwind needs `unsafe-eval`; cdnjs/jsdelivr; Umami/Sentry; TradingView).
- **Subresource Integrity (SRI)** on pinned CDN scripts (Three.js, PDF.js, Chart.js).
- **`sentinel-history` writes are server-gated** (closed the old anonymous-write hole).
- **Input validation** (regex/allow-lists) + **per-IP rate limiting** on every proxy.
- **Source-exposure hardening:** `.vercelignore` keeps `scripts/`, raw sources, source maps, the
  `.docx`, and `*.md` (incl. this handbook) off the public surface; the client is minified/bundled.

---

## 7. Assumptions, simplifications & known limitations

**Sentinel** — synthetic, not market spreads; PoD overstates IG default risk (LGD=100%); anchors
are hand-calibrated and decay (verification badge); `ratingIndexBps`/`sectorVol` depend on
Alpha/FRED availability (fallbacks exist). Auto-calibration only spot-checks 3 names per cycle.

**Osiris** — constant per-ticker physics params; OU mean is a 1-yr arithmetic average; jump params
are static; foreign filers and thin-data names degrade; correlation across names is not modelled
(single-name only). Drift = riskfree − dividend yield (no equity-risk-premium term).

**FinVault** — XBRL tag coverage varies (some filers omit `OperatingIncomeLoss` etc. → "N/A");
foreign 20-F / PDF-only names lack SEC `companyfacts` (5-yr panel falls back to Yahoo's ~4 yrs or
hides); the deep-dive narrative is Claude-generated (reviewed before publish); multiples over time
are not point-in-time-perfect. Reports are pre-generated, so fundamentals are as fresh as the last
run.

**General** — rate limits are soft (per warm instance unless Upstash is set); `x-forwarded-for` is
trusted as the platform sets it; Yahoo's cookie/crumb scraping is unofficial and can break.

These are scope lines, not bugs — each is a clean place to add depth.

## 9. How to give NovaSect better prompts (using this document)

Naming the parts makes prompts precise:
- **Reference the engine/leg:** *"In `sentinel.v2.js`, add a liquidity leg to the spread that
  widens when the bid-ask proxy rises, and surface it in `getSpreadDrivers`."*
- **Reference the physics:** *"In `stochasticWorker.js`, add a stochastic-volatility (Heston) path
  option for the Industrials cohort, behind a config flag in `physics-config.json`."*
- **Reference the data source:** *"Extend `sec-proxy.js` to also return shares-outstanding history
  so FinVault can show buyback/dilution over 5 years."*
- **Keep the invariants:** *"…client-side, explainable, no key in the browser, and add it behind the
  existing proxy + rate-limit pattern."* After any client edit: **run `npm run build` and commit
  the `.min` outputs** (Vercel does a no-op build).

### Natural next directions (impact-for-effort)
1. **FinVault risk scorecard** — Altman-Z / Piotroski-F / Beneish-M from the 5-yr XBRL + cross-link
   Sentinel credit risk and Osiris forward risk (the planned "Phase 2/3").
2. **FinVault 5-year event timeline** — SEC 8-K item codes + dividends/splits/earnings surprises.
3. **Sentinel multi-name correlation** and a portfolio credit view.
4. **Osiris**: Heston/stochastic-vol, multi-asset correlated paths, scenario overlays.
5. **Server-side spread snapshot writer** (cron) to repopulate Sentinel history authoritatively.
